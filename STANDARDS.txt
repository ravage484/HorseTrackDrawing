Flutter and Dart Coding Standards

    1. Code Formatting:
    - Use 'dartfmt' (Dart's built-in formatter) for automatic code formatting.
    - Keep line length to a maximum of 80 characters.

    2. Naming Conventions:
    - Use UpperCamelCase for class names and enums.
    - Use lowerCamelCase for method names and variables.
    - Use lower_snake_case for file names.
    - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.

    3. Effective Dart Guidelines:
    - Follow Dart's official style guide: Effective Dart (https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart).
    - Prioritize readability and maintainability.

    4. Documentation and Comments:
    - Document all public APIs with /// doc comments.
    - Use regular // comments for inline explanations and clarifications.
    - Avoid redundant comments; code should be self-explanatory wherever possible.

    5. Code Organization:
    - Organize code into libraries and part files appropriately.
    - Use extensions judiciously to add functionality to existing classes.

    6. State Management:
    - Choose an appropriate state management approach (Provider, Bloc, etc.) based on project complexity.
    - Keep UI and business logic separate.

    7. Error Handling:
    - Use try-catch for error handling and avoid using prints.
    - Prefer using Future and async-await for handling asynchronous code.

    8. Testing:
    - Write unit tests for business logic.
    - Write widget tests for UI components.
    - Aim for a high test coverage.

    9. Dependencies:
    - Keep your pubspec.yaml file organized and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
    - Regularly update dependencies to maintain compatibility and security.

    10. Performance Best Practices:
        - Use const widgets where possible.
        - Avoid unnecessary re-renders and rebuilds.
        - Profile performance and optimize bottlenecks.

    11. Accessibility and Internationalization:
        - Ensure your app is accessible (use semantics, sufficient contrast, etc.).
        - Internationalize your app to support multiple languages.

    12. Use of Packages and Plugins:
        - Prefer using well-maintained and widely used packages.
        - Check the health score, popularity, and points on pub.dev before using a package.

Flutter Project Folder Structure Best Practices

    1. lib/: Main directory for Dart code.
    - src/: Contains the majority of the code, kept out of the global namespace.
        - models/: Contains data model classes.
        - views/: Contains all UI code, typically Flutter widgets.
        - widgets/: For custom reusable widgets used across the app.
        - controllers/ or providers/: For state management logic.
        - services/: For network calls, database access, or other services.
        - utils/: Utility/helper functions and constants.
    - main.dart: The starting point of the application.

    2. assets/: Contains all assets like images, fonts, and localization files.
    - images/
    - fonts/

    3. test/: Contains all Dart tests.

    Additional Tips:
    - Keep it Modular: Break down complex widgets into smaller components.
    - Follow Naming Conventions: Use lower_snake_case for filenames; UpperCamelCase for classes and enums.
    - State Management: Place state management files in a dedicated directory like controllers/ or providers/.
    - Use Relative Imports within lib/: Prefer relative imports for files inside the lib/ directory.
    - Localization: For multi-language support, consider a l10n/ directory under lib/ for localization files.

    Example Directory Structure:
    lib/
    src/
        models/
        user.dart
        product.dart
        views/
        home_screen.dart
        settings_screen.dart
        widgets/
        custom_button.dart
        user_tile.dart
        controllers/
        user_controller.dart
        services/
        api_service.dart
        utils/
        constants.dart
        utilities.dart
    main.dart
    assets/
    images/
    fonts/
    test/
    widget_test.dart
    unit_test.dart

    Final Thoughts:
    - Adapt as Needed: The structure is a guideline and should be adapted to the project's needs.
    - Consistency is Key: Maintain consistency throughout the project.
    - Review and Refactor: Continuously review and refactor the structure as the project grows.
